"The Opioid Crisis is truly that - a crisis. Over the past 20 years, opioids have become a commonly used recreational drug. As people use these drugs, they become addicted. Opioid abuse often starts with a legitimate prescription as a treatment for pain. However, the addictive nature of the drug can cause people to seek out more opioids after their prescription is over. In small doses, opioids are effective painkillers that may make you feel drowsy. In large doses (abuse), opioids can result in slowed breathing and a slowed heart-rate. These effects can cause death - otherwise known as an overdose."  In their post <a href="https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-Pill-Posse/" target="blank">here</a>, the Pill Posse team includes interactive maps, k-means clustering, and linear regression to explore the relationship between opioid prescription rate and overdose rate, and to identify which (if any) states are disproportionately affected.
