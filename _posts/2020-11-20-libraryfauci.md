"Sexual health is still a taboo topic across the United States. The openness in conversations about this topic vary by state, community, family, and even individual. As a result, students across the nation have vastly different sexual education experiences: some are like the above scene in Mean Girls and others more comprehensive."  In their post <a href="https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-library-Fauci/" target="blank">here</a>, library(Fauci) addresses questions like "How do state sexual health education mandates affect student health outcomes?" and "Do state education mandates correspond to the policies schools enact and the material teachers choose to emphasize?" among others.
