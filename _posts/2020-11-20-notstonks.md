"Take a look at the clothes tag for the new shirt you just bought, at the bottom of that jug right by your table, or at the bottom of the Macbook in front of you. How many of them actually say made in America? Or do you see 'made in China', 'made in Vietnam', 'made in Germany', etc?  The reason why those objects exist in front of you is all due to trade."  In their post, Not Stonks incorporates interactive Leaflet maps, k-means clustering analysis, and networks to explores international trade.
